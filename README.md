# SimpleBLDC

This is simple Arduino based 650W BLDC motor(with Hall sensors) controller. Designed with [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/). This controller has version V0.1, which means it is still under development. **The source files can be changed.**

The device has the following features:
- XT60 power connector;
- Arduino Nano V3.0 main controller;
- Overcurrent protection (fuse);
- Reverse polarity protection;
- The ability to work with non-collector motors via Hall sensors (electric scooter or electric bicycle);
- Monitoring and control of the current of each phase (current is measured in both positive and negative directions);
- Current control by PWM, operating frequency 16/32 kHz;
- Has a connector for connecting a traction control potentiometer and a reverse button.

# Schematic

The device has 3 drivers for mosfet transistors, as well as 3 current sensors based on the Hall effect, which measure both in the positive and negative directions. The use of 3 sensors is the reason for the development of the device for regenerative braking.

# PCB

The board consists of two layers: top and bottom. All the main parts are located on the top layer.
